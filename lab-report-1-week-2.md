## CSE 15L Week 1 Lab: Logging into ieng6 course-specific accounts

1. Install VSCode
2. Connect to the remote server
3. Commands
4. Move files using scp
5. Set up SSH key to log in faster
6. Optimizing remote running

The first step is to download VSCode. I already had it downloaded, but if you don't have it, you can download it here: [VScode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Next, to connect to the remote server, make sure you have SSH downloaded (if on Windows) and that you have the name of your course account. Then open a terminal in VScode using Terminal -> New Terminal. The command to connect to the remote server is:

```
ssh cs15lwi22zaao@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
Enter your password, and you should be able to connect.
