# CSE 15L Week 8 Lab: Large Amounts of Tests
[Home](index.html)

I found the tests with different results by [insert].

For each test:

    Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think neither is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
    
    For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the _bug (the problem in the code). You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed.
